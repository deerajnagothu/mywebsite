Hello, This is my first post in my online blog "Explore Entropy". The term *Entropy* is defined as a measure of uncertainty in Information Theory, and I have dedicated my life to the pursuit of exploring the uncertain. 



I plan to use this blog as my public writing journal to share my learning experiences. I intend to perform thorough research before I publish my opinions. I understand that there are always things to learn and room to grow. I hope writing in public will provide the opportunity to learn, create and repeat. Currently, my plans for this blog include creating a public accountability system, sharing my notes and thoughts on the articles or books I read, explain complex scientific concepts as a way for better learning and sharing my thoughts on personal development experiments I conduct.

I hope the year 2021 marks a new beginning for many of us who wants to embark upon journey of their own towards our better selves. As James Clear (author of Atomic Habits) says,

>  You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems. 


I hope everyone has a healthy and peaceful New Year!
